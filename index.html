    <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
    <p>When you hear "Tokyo", what do you think of? 
      You probably answered with something like Godzilla or Sonic the Hedgehog, maybe you think of Buddhist monks and temples, or maybe you just think of your favorite food. 
      All of these are good examples of why everyone loves Tokyo, but when I hear Tokyo I think of the first high-speed bullet train, I think of automation, and I think of artificial intelligence. 
      Tokyo is the leader in technological innovations and they constantly push the boundaries when it comes to using technology for the betterment of life.
